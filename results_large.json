    "question": "What is artificial intelligence and when was it founded?",
    "answer": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. AI was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.",

    "question": "How do neural networks work in AI?",
    "answer": "An artificial neural network in AI is based on a collection of nodes, also known as artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers. Learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm. Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function.",

    "question": "What are the ethical concerns related to AI?",
    "answer": "Ethical concerns related to AI include considerations during the design, development, and implementation of an AI system. There are concerns about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology. Unintended consequences and risks have been identified, especially when AI systems do not factor ethics and bias into their training processes. The use of AI has also raised concerns about privacy, surveillance, and copyright due to the large amounts of data required for machine learning algorithms. AI's ability to create and modify content, such as non-consensual deepfake pornography, has led to significant ethical and legal concerns. There are also debates about whether machines can be conscious and the associated ethical implications.",
